    "# Project: AI Companions & Radicalisation Drift\n",
    "### A computational study on the intersection of digital intimacy and grievance narratives\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Summary\n",
    "This project investigates the potential migration of users from **AI-companion communities** (e.g., *Replika, CharacterAI*) toward **radicalized or grievance-driven subreddits** (e.g., *IncelExit, FemaleDatingStrategy*).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** Does obsessive engagement with AI partners correlate with a drift toward toxic or radicalized worldviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Overview:**\n",
    "To answer this, I implement a multi-method pipeline across several notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1. Data Collection:** Robust scraping of community interactions via Reddit JSON API (this notebook).\n",
    "* **2. NLP Analysis:** Extracting latent narrative themes and tracking sentiment shifts across different user groups.\n",
    "* **3 & 4. Supervised Learning:** Training models to identify linguistic markers associated with radicalisation and predict user categories.\n",
    "* **5. Network Analysis (SNA):** Mapping the structural overlaps and migration pathways between intimacy-seeking and grievance-seeking communities.\n",
    "* **6. Agent-Based Modelling (ABM):** Simulating the dynamics of user drift and opinion radicalization under varying social conditions."

    "## 2. Why Reddit Data?\n",
    "Reddit offers a unique environment where two distinct subcultures coexist and overlap:\n",
    "1.  **Intimacy-Seeking:** Users discussing deep emotional/romantic bonds with AI agents.\n",
    "2.  **Grievance-Seeking:** Communities focused on gender-related frustrations (Incels, Femcels).\n",
    "\n",
    "This open-access data is ideal for measuring:\n",
    "* **Linguistic Drift:** How language changes as users move between these groups.\n",
    "* **User Migration:** Tracing authors who post in both clusters.\n",

    "## 3. Methodology: Public JSON API\n",
    "Instead of using Reddit’s OAuth API (which currently has unstable access approval for students), this project utilizes **Reddit’s public JSON endpoints**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach?**\n",
    "* **Reproducibility:** The code runs on any machine without requiring unique API keys or manual app approval.\n",
    "* **Reliability:** Bypasses frequent OAuth outages and IP restrictions.\n",
    "* **Sufficiency:** The endpoints (e.g., `https://www.reddit.com/r/SUB/new.json`) provide all necessary metadata (text, timestamps, authors, scores) required for NLP and SNA.\n",

    "\n",
    "### A. AI & Parasocial Attachment (The \"Origin\")\n",
    "*Subreddits focused on AI companionship, emotional dependence, and immersive roleplay.*\n",
    "* **Targets:** `r/Replika`, `r/CharacterAI`, `r/MyBoyfriendIsAI`, `r/BeyondThePromptAI`, `r/AIRelationships`, `r/cogsuckers` (high-intensity use), and related communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Grievance & Radicalisation (The \"Destination\")\n",
    "*Subreddits associated with gender-based grievances, incel/femcel ideologies, and \"pill\" debates.*\n",
    "* **Targets:** `r/IncelExit`, `r/FemaleDatingStrategy`, `r/PurplePillDebate`, `r/ForeverAlone`, `r/exredpill` etc..\n",

    "* **Privacy:** Data is used strictly for academic analysis; no individual profiling is performed.\n",

    "1.  **Scraping:** Iterates through target subreddits using the JSON API with strict rate-limiting.\n",
    "2.  **Extraction:** Parses nested JSON to extract key features (Title, Selftext, Comments, Timestamps).\n",
    "3.  **Unification:** Merges disparate sources into a single, structured dataset.\n",

    "    * We consolidate these artifacts (along with comment `body`) into a single master **`text`** column to ensure a consistent input feature for NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Temporal Formatting:**\n",
    "    * The `created_utc` (Unix timestamp) is converted into a readable **`date`** object to enable longitudinal analysis (e.g., tracking sentiment drift over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Categorization (Feature Engineering):**\n",
    "    * We apply a mapping function to classify each subreddit into analytical groups: **`ai`** (Origin) vs. **`grievance`** (Destination).\n",
    "    * This creates the `subreddit_category` column, which is the primary target variable for our comparative study.\n",

    "### Final Dataset Quality & Sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the rigorous cleaning process (removal of ~13% orphaned rows), the final dataset remains **highly robust** and **sufficient** for the project's analytical goals. The quality control steps have ensured that every remaining record is fully attributable to specific communities, which actually enhances the reliability of the downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is why the *cleaned* dataset is optimal for the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **High Semantic Signal-to-Noise Ratio (for NLP)**\n",
    "    By removing comments lacking subreddit context, we have eliminated \"noise\" that would have confused topic models. The remaining **~110,000 text units** represent a dense, high-quality corpus sufficient to train stable embeddings and detect subtle sentiment shifts without the interference of unlinked data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Valid Network Topology (for SNA)**\n",
    "    For Social Network Analysis, \"broken edges\" (interactions without a known community) are analytically useless. The cleaning process ensures that **100% of the remaining nodes** have valid community labels. This allows for the construction of a complete, unbroken graph of user migration, which is far more valuable than a larger but fragmented network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Statistical Significance (for ML)**\n",
    "    Even after cleaning, the dataset retains tens of thousands of examples across both \"AI-Companion\" and \"Radical/Grievance\" classes. This volume far exceeds the minimum requirements for logistic regression and classifier training, ensuring that our models will not overfit to sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Empirical Grounding (for ABM)**\n",
    "    The dataset preserves the core behavioral distributions (post frequency, sentiment trajectory) needed to parameterize the Agent-Based Model. The removal of technical artifacts ensures that the simulated agents are based on verified, high-confidence user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The data cleaning process has traded a small percentage of raw volume for **significantly higher data integrity**. The resulting dataset is now fully preprocessed, structurally valid, and ready for immediate use in the NLP, ML, and Network Analysis notebooks."
