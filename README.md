# Radicalisation Drift: Computational Analysis of Online Communities

This project investigates linguistic, structural, and behavioral differences between AI-companion and grievance-oriented online communities using computational social science methods.

## Overview

The project combines multiple analytical approaches to explore whether online communities form structural and linguistic pathways that may facilitate ideological migration.

## Methods

- Web scraping and data collection
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) discourse analysis
- Regression modeling
- Social Network Analysis (SNA)
- Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)

## Repository Structure

notebooks/ - analysis notebooks
data/ - dataset (sample)

## Goal

The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end computational social science workflow, from data collection to modeling and interpretation of social dynamics in online environments.
